## CryptoAssetLab

![CryptoAssetLab logo](images/cal6.svg)

The CryptoAssetLab is
a scientific and technologic center about crypto-assets
([bitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/) _in primis_)
as investment opportunity, technological innovation,
and regulatory challenge.
We also pay attention to the innovations in cryptography and
blockchain technology, because of their relevance for privacy,
security, and other applications
(timestamping _in primis_, see
[OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/)).

We aim to be a meeting point between academia, industry,
institutions, and regulators; we encourage students, researchers,
and practitioners to join us and help with
research, development, training, teaching, and
other experimental activities.
