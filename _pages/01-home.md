## Mission Statement

The Crypto Asset Lab is
a research center about crypto assets
([bitcoin](http://bitcoincore.org/) _in primis_)
as investment opportunity, fintech innovation,
and regulatory challenge.
We also pay attention to the innovations in cryptography and
blockchain technology, because of their relevance for privacy,
security, and other applications
([timestamping](http://dgi.io/ots/) _in primis_, see
[OpenTimestamps](http://opentimestamps.org/)).

We aim to be a meeting point between academia, industry,
institutions, and regulators; we encourage students, researchers,
and practitioners to join us and help with
research, development, training, teaching, and
other experimental activities.
