### Abstract Submission

Abstracts must be submitted using the dedicated
[web form](https://forms.gle/r8GFncNuSgjqWbEn7).

Abstract submissions must include titles, authors, abstracts,
topics, etc.
(everything except the final PDF of the paper).
The program selection criteria include
the nature of the research topic, the economic implications
of the research, and the academic quality of the research design.
Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap
with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for
publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with

research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable
