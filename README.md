### Mission Statement

The [Crypto Asset Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}) (CAL)
is a research initiative
on bitcoin and crypto assets
as investment opportunity, fintech innovation,
and regulatory challenge,
with special regard for their disruptive role
in the future of money and finance.

Also, we pay attention to the innovations
in cryptography and blockchain technology,
given their relevance for privacy,
security, and other applications
(e.g. [timestamping](http://dgi.io/ots/), see
[OpenTimestamps](http://opentimestamps.org/)).

CAL is a meeting point between academia, industry,
institutions, and regulators; we encourage students, researchers,
and practitioners to join us and help with
research, development, training, teaching, and
other experimental activities.

Check out our [yearly conference]({{ site.baseurl }}/calconf).
