## CryptoAssetLab

The crypto-asset Laboratory is
a scientific and technologic R&C center
about crypto-assets, bitcoin _in primis_,
as investment opportunity, technological innovation,
and regulatory challenge.
We also pay attention to the innovations in cryptography and
blockchain technology, their relevance for privacy and
possible broader applications
(timestamping _in primis_, see
[OpenTimestamps](www.opentimestamps.org)).

We aim to be a meeting point between academia, industry,
institutions, and regulators; we encourage students, research,
and practitioners to join us and help with
research, teaching, and experimentation activities.

The lab is a joint initiative between the
academic and scientific community of
[Milano Bicocca University](www.unimib.it) and the
[Digital Gold Institute](www.dgi.io) (DGI) with its recognized
expertise and reputation in the crypto-ecosystem:
Milano Bicocca has been offering since 2015 a
"Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology"
seminar course, by Ferdinando Ametrano (DGI Executive Director).
