### Mission Statement

The [Crypto Asset Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}) (CAL)
is a joint research initiative by the
[Department of Business and Law of Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca](https://www.diseade.unimib.it/en)
and the
[Digital Gold Institute](https://www.dgi.io).

Our focus is on
bitcoin and crypto assets as investment opportunity,
fintech innovation,
and regulatory challenges,
with special regard for their disruptive role
in the future of money and finance.

Also, we pay attention to the innovations
in cryptography and blockchain technology,
given their relevance for privacy,
security, and other applications
(e.g. [timestamping](https://dgi.io/ots/), see
[OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org/)).

CAL is a meeting point between academia, industry,
institutions, and regulators; we encourage students, researchers,
and practitioners to join us and help with
research, development, training, teaching, and
other experimental activities.
