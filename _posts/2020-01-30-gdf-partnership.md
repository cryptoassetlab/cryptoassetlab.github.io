Crypto Asset Lab (CAL) has joined
[Global Digital Finance](https://www.gdf.io/) (GDF).
GDF is a leading industry membership body that promotes
the acceleration and adoption of best practices for
crypto assets and digital finance technologies.

The [partnership](https://www.gdf.io/members-directory/)
agreement is for CAL the opportunity to be part
of one of the most relevant digital finance community
and it allows mutual exchange in industrial, technological,
and academic matters.

GDF is devoting a significant attention to FAFT-GAFI's activities,
which are crucial in shaping the regulatory future of the crypto
asset ecosystem.
Indeed, the CAL/GDF partnership has originated from the
common interest in monitoring and possibly addressing these developments:
namely, it originated from CAL's
[contribution paper](https://www.gdf.io/docsconsultations/part-viii-code-of-conduct-principles-for-know-your-customer-kyc-anti-money-laundering-aml/)
(by *G. L. Aleo*, *V. Barbera* and *A. Castronuovo*)
to the recent GDF consultation
(see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/2019/09/30/Crypto-AML-landscape.html)).

With the seal of this partnership, CAL becomes GDF's first Italian partner.
