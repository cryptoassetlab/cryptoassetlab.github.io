May the 6th, in concluding the IVMS101 plenary session, marked a profound, pivotal moment in collaborative efforts, across the crypto-asset industry and all other sectors, to solve a common challenge: the need for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to adopt uniform approaches and establish common standards to enable them to meet their obligations resulting from the FATF Recommendations as they apply to affected entities.

To tackle this, a cross-industry, cross-sectoral joint working group (JWG) of technical experts was formed in December 2019  by [Chamber of Digital Commerce](https://digitalchamber.org/), [Global Digital Finance](https://www.gdf.io/) and [International Digital Asset Exchange Association](http://idaxa.org/).
Crypto Asset Lab , rapresented by [_Vito Barbera_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-barbera-44883a89/?originalSubdomain=it), has been an active Member of JWG on interVASP Messaging Standards.

The JWG, comprising over 130 technical experts from around the world, developed [interVASP Messaging Standard IVMS101](https://intervasp.org/), the new technical standard aims to facilitate exchange of data (payload) between VASPs.
It has been a long journey through 18th rotating meetings and 1 plenary session all over the world.

Congratulations to all the JWG members and observers, in particular to [_Si√¢n Jones_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sianjonescoinsult/) as Convenor of JWG, [_Neil Samtani_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neilsamtani/) as technical editor, co-leads [_Amy Kim_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amydavinekim/), Malcolm Wright and [_Anson Zeall_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansonzeall/) for the milestone result, and to [_Vito Barbera_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vito-barbera-44883a89/?originalSubdomain=it) for his effort and commitment in rapresenting CAL in this important achievement for the crypto-asset industry.
